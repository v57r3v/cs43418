java cPPOL 5014– 07 Thesis Workshop II Spring 2025 Course Syllabus This semester, you will continue the work we started last Fall and complete your original empirical thesis by the end of the Spring Semester. You have done very well so far, but we still have work to do.The final product of the thesis workshop course is a complete draft of your master’s thesis, and there is a firm deadline for this: April 16, 2025.Class and Individual Meetings This semester, we will meet in person several times as a class, but I will primarily hold individual meetings.Class Meetings:- January 14- February 11- March 11 – Writing Center Workshop (6:30 PM – 7:30 PM, mandatory)- April 1- April 15Individual Meetings: I will meet with students individually during times when the class does not meet as a group. Appointments will be posted on the Canvas calendar.
Grading and late assignment policy.  
Throughout the semester, you will have several assignments, and they will determine your final grade.       It’s essential to deliver assignments by the deadline.       It allows me to provide comments and will enable you to address my comments before the next assignment.       Unless you have a documented excuse (illness, death in the family, university-sponsored trip, etc.), late assignments delivered within three days from the deadline will receive at most 50% of the grade.    However, I will allow one late assignment in the semester without penalty if it's three or fewer days later.    If your assignment is more than three days late, I will provide comments as time permits, but you will receive a 0 for the assignment.    No exception.
If you identify that you are having difficulties completing any of the assignments, please feel free to contact me for help before the due date.
All the deliverables are listed below and should be submitted electronically on Canvas.
